I am an artist working with paper and paint and I'm currently interested in portraiture. Historically, portraits were created for memorial and rememberance and in my work I am trying to make concrete the haziness of memory. The elements of my work are pulling and tugging against precise draftsmanship and the constantly shifting inner glow of a subject that is hard to pin down.
